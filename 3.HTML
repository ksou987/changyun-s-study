<h2>JavaScript</h2>
<p>
  JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),[7] often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, interpreted programming language. It is a language which is also characterized as dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based and multi-paradigm.

  Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of the World Wide Web.[8] JavaScript enables interactive web pages and thus is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use it,[9] and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.
